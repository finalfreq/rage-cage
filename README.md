# Rage Cage

Rage Cage was a project for my rails week 1 course at Epicodus. The idea for the app was to create a fan site of our choice. We Choose to make a nicholas cage fan site.

## Usage

To run this project you must have rails installed.

Open project in terminal and run bundle to install necessary gems and run the following in terminal.

```
rake db:create
rake db:seed
rake db:migrate
rails s
```

You should then be able to open on localhost:3000. You can then post your favorite images of nicolas cage. We also had added a battles section where people can vote on favorite picture of two pictures.
